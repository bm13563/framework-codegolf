# framework-codegolf
an attempt to build a frontend framework in under 100 lines of javascript

vague aims:

- under 100 lines of javascript
- reactive state
- event handlers
- scoped css
- state watchers

what it is not:

- safe (vulnerable to xss)
- fast (no vdom, components are wholly re-rendered)
- user friendly (verbose class-based components)
- clean (i will be cutting many corners)
